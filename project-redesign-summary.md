     - Before/After comparison images (500x300px)

3. **Testing**
   - Test all pages in desktop and mobile viewports
   - Verify dark theme consistency
   - Ensure all links work correctly

## Implementation Notes

1. **CSS Implementation**
   - Using the non-minified CSS file (project-case-study.css) for better maintainability
   - Attempted to create a minified version but encountered truncation issues

2. **Image Placeholders**
   - Until proper images are created, the pages will display broken image links
   - Follow the guidelines in placeholder-readme.txt for creating appropriate images

3. **Responsive Design**
   - The template includes responsive design for mobile devices
   - Side-by-side layouts stack vertically on smaller screens
   - Font sizes adjust for better readability on mobile

4. **Accessibility**
   - Maintained accessible contrast levels for text on dark backgrounds
   - Used semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Update the remaining project pages using the template-project.html as a reference
2. Create the necessary images for each project
3. Test all pages thoroughly in different browsers and devices
4. Deploy the updated portfolio
